   \item Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$,
         and let $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. Compute the sum of the roots of $g$.

      \textbf{Solution.} First we observe that $c$ is a root of $f$ if and only
      if $c-5$ is a root of $g$. If $f$ has a rational root, then the Rational
      Root Theorem says that it must be a divisor of $2015$. Since
      $2015 = 5 \cdot 13 \cdot 31 \cdot 403$, it follows that the candidates for 
      the rational roots of $f$ are
      $$\pm1, \pm5, \pm13, \pm31, \pm65, \pm155, \pm403, \text{ and } \pm2015.$$
      Now $f(1) \neq -1440$ and $f(5) = 0$. Thus 5 is a root of $f$. By
      division and further factorization, we get
      $$f(x) = (x - 5)(x^2 -44x + 403) = (x - 5)(x - 13)(x - 31),$$
      so that the roots of $f$ are 5, 13, and 31. Thus the sum of the roots of
      $g$ is
      $$(5 - 5) + (13 - 5) + (31 - 5) = 34.$$

   \item Lay six long strings in parallel. Two people (each of whom cannot see
         what the other is doing) work at opposite ends of the bundle of
         strings. Each randomly pairs off the strings at his or her end and
         glues together the ends of each pair. Then stretch the strings out.
         What is the probability that the strings now form a single large loop?

      \textbf{Solution.} For $i$ = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, suppose that person
      $i$ and person $i+1$ are at the end of string $(i + 1) / 2$. To form a
      loop, we will choose any of the persons at random as a starting position,
      say person $y$. Person $y$ will then choose any random person (except the
      person opposite person $y$) from the other 10 available persons. So
      suppose that person $y$ chooses person $x$. Now the person opposite person
      $x$ must now choose another random person. At any point, a person may not
      choose from a string that a previous person has already chosen from. When
      there are no more vacant persons, the last person must glue his side of
      the string to person $y$'s. Thus 
      there are
      $$10 \cdot 8 \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 = 3840$$
      ways to form a loop. The total number of ways of gluing the ends of the
      strings is
      $$\frac{12!}{2!^66!} = 10395.$$
      Hence the probability that the strings now form a single large loop is
      $\D\frac{3840}{10395} = \frac{256}{693}$.

   \item Compute the product $\D\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
         \frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
         \frac{4\pi}{5}\right)$.

      \textbf{Solution.} We note that if $x + y = \pi$, then
      $$\cos(y) = \cos(\pi - x) = \cos(\pi)\cos(x) +
        \sin(\pi)\sin(x) = -\cos(x).$$
      Since $\D\frac{\pi}{5} + \frac{4\pi}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{5} +
      \frac{3\pi}{5} = \pi$, it follows that
      \begin{align*}
         \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
            \frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
            \frac{4\pi}{5}\right) &= \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
            \frac{4\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
            \frac{3\pi}{5}\right) \\
            &= \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
               \frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\cos\left(
               \frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \\
            &= \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\cos^2\left(
                  \frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \\
            &= \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\left[2\cos^2\left(
                  \frac{\pi}{5}\right) - 1\right]^2 \\
            &= \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2\left(2\left(
                  \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2 - 1\right)^2 \\
            &= \frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{8}\left(\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2 \\
            &= \frac{1}{16}.
      \end{align*}

      \textbf{Note. In the above I used the equality (from}

      \verb|http://www.math-only-math.com/exact-value-of-cos-18-degree.html|):
      $$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$
      \textbf{I forgot how to derive it, so I looked it up.}

   \item Compute the number of ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that
         \begin{equation} \label{4_2}
            \frac{1}{x} + \frac{540}{xy} = 2.
         \end{equation}

      \textbf{Solution.} Clearly neither of $x$ and $y$ is 0, so multiply
      Equation \eqref{4_2} by $xy$ to get $y + 540 = 2xy$. Rearrange to get
      \begin{equation} \label{4_1}
         y(2x - 1) = 540.
      \end{equation}
      Equation \eqref{4_1} tells us that $(2x - 1)$ is an odd factor of 540.
      Since $540 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5$, it follows that the odd factors of
      540 are
      $$\pm1, \pm3, \pm9, \pm27, \pm5, \pm 15, \pm45, \text{ and } \pm135.$$
      That is, $(2x - 1)$ must be one of the factors above, so that Equation
      \eqref{4_1} has 16 ordered pairs of solutions. Now in each of the 16
      solutions the $y$ component cannot be 0 since Equation \eqref{4_1} says
      that the $y$ component is always a factor of 540; however, $(0, -540)$ is
      a solution of Equation \eqref{4_1}, so we shall exclude it. Thus there are
      15 solutions to Equation \eqref{4_2}. Listed explicitly, they are:
      $(-67, -4)$, $(-22, -12)$, $(-13, -20)$, $(-7, -36)$, $(-4, -60)$,
      $(-2, -108)$, $(-1, -180)$, $(1, 540)$, $(2, 180)$, $(3, 108)$, $(5, 60)$, 
      $(8, 36), (14, 20)$, $(23, 12)$, and $(68, 4)$.

   \item Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n + i$,
         $(n + i)^2$, and $(n + i)^3$ are the vertices of a triangle in the
         complex plane whose area is greater than 2015.

      \textbf{Solution.} Let $A(x_1, y_1)$, $B(x_2, y_2)$, and $C(x_3, y_3)$ be
      points in the $xy$-plane; then it can be shown that
      $$\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2}\left|\det\left(
        \begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
           1 & 1 & 1 \\
           $x_1$ & $x_2$ & $x_3$ \\
           $y_1$ & $y_2$ & $y_3$
        \end{tabular}\right)\right|,
      $$
      where $\det(M)$ is the determinant of a matrix $M$. Now suppose
      $$z_1 = a_1 + b_1i, z_2 = a_2 + b_2i, \text{ and } z_3 = a_3 + b_3i$$
      are the vertices of a triangle in the complex plane; also suppose that $s$
      is the area of this triangle. Letting $\overline{z}$ denote the conjugate
      of the complex number $z$ and using the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item the determinant of a matrix is invariant under addition of a 
               multiple of a row to another and
         \item multiplying a row by a scalar multiplies the determinant by the 
               same scalar,
      \end{itemize}
      it follows that
      \begin{align*}
         s &= \frac{1}{2}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

           &= \frac{1}{2i}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

           &= \frac{1}{-4i}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

           &= \frac{1}{-4i}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

                  $a_1-b_1i$ & $a_2-b_2i$ & $a_3-b_3i$

              \end{tabular}\right)\right|.
      \end{align*}

      Now, for a positive integer $n$, let $s_n$ denote the area of a triangle 
      with vertices $n + i$, $(n + i)^2$, and $(n + i)^3$ in the complex plane.
      As previously shown, it follows that
      \begin{align*}
         s_n &= \frac{i}{4}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

             &= \frac{i}{4}\left|\det\left(\begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}

                   $n+i$ & $(n+i)^2$ & $(n+i)^3$ \\
                   $n-i$ & $(n-i)^2$ & $(n-i)^3$
                \end{tabular}\right)\right| \\
            &= \frac{i}{4} \left|(n+i)^2(n-i)^3-(n+i)^3(n-i)^2+ 
                  (n+i)^3(n-i)-(n+i)(n-i)^3+ \right.\\
                  &\quad \left.\quad (n+i)(n-i)^2-(n+i)^2(n-i)\right| \\
            &= \frac{i}{4} \left|(n+i)^2(n-i)^2[(n-i)-(n+i)]+ 
                  (n+i)(n-i)[(n+i)^2-(n-i)^2]+ \right.\\
                  &\quad \left.\quad (n+i)(n-i)[(n-i)-(n+i)]\right| \\
            &= \frac{i}{4} \left|(n+i)^2(n-i)^2(-2i)+ 
                  (n^2+1)(4ni)+ (n^2+1)(-2i)\right| \\

            &= \frac{1}{4} (n^2+1)(2(n^2+1)-4n+2) \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} (n^2+1)(n^2-2n+2).
      \end{align*}
      
      Since $s_8 = 1625 < 2015$ and $s_9 = 2665 > 2015$, it follows that the
      desired answer is $n = 9$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%06%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item A loop is made connecting rods of lengths 1, 2, \ldots, 90 in that
         order. (The rod of length 90 is connected to the rods of lengths 89 and
         1.) The loop is laid in the shape of an equilateral triangle of
         perimeter 4095. Rods cannot be bent or broken. Compute the sum of the
         shortest rods on each side of the triangle. (For example, the loop with
         rods 1, 2, \ldots, 9 can be arranged into an equilateral triangle
         because 4 + 5 + 6 = 7 + 8 = 9 + 1 + 2 + 3.)
         
      \textbf{Solution.} We shall be using the fact that the $n$-th sum of an
      arithmetic sequence with first term $a$ and common difference $d$ is
      $$\frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d).$$
      Suppose the side that contains the rod of length 1 is of the form
      $$1 + 2 + \cdots + k$$
      for some $1 < k < 90$. Thus it follows that
      $$1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 1365,$$
      so that $k^2+k-2730=0$, a quadratic equation with no integral solution.
      Thus no such $k$ exists. We then hypothesize that there exist positive
      integers $n$, $h$, and $m$ such that the sides of the triangle are of the
      following forms (the sides have been arbitrarily labelled):
      
      \textbf{Side 1.}
      $$n + (n + 1) + \cdots + 90 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + h = 1365.$$
      
      \textbf{Side 2.}
      $$(h + 1) + (h + 2) + \cdots + (h + m) = 1365.$$
      
      \textbf{Side 3.}
      $$(h + m + 1) + \cdots (n - 1) = 1365.$$
      
      For side 1, we have
      \begin{align*}
         1365 &= n + (n + 1) + \cdots + 90 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + h \\
              &= \frac{(90 + n)(91 - n)}{2} + \frac{h(h+1)}{2},
      \end{align*}
      so that
      \begin{equation} \label{6_1}
         n^2 - n - (h^2+h+5460) = 0.
      \end{equation}
      For side 2, we have
      $$1365 = (h + 1) + (h + 2) + \cdots + (h + m) = \frac{m}{2}(2h+m+1),$$
      so that
      \begin{equation} \label{6_2}
         m(2h+m+1) = 2730.
      \end{equation}
      Equation \eqref{6_2} tells us that $m$ is a factor of 2730. Now since
      $2730 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$, it follows that there are
      at most 32 pairs of $m$ and $h$ that satisfy Equation \eqref{6_2}.
      Observe that $h$ and $m$ are both less than 90 and $h + m < 90$; hence we
      can whittle down the solutions. A few computations will lead us to the
      following candidates ($m$ is first component and $h$ is second) for the
      solutions of Equation  \eqref{6_2}:
      $$(21, 54), (26, 39), (30, 30), (35, 21), (39, 15), \text{ and }
        (42, 11).$$
      Now if we plug in the values of $h$ above in Equation \eqref{6_1}, we
      shall notice that only $h = 15$ produces an integral value of $n$;
      specifically, we shall get $n = 76$. Thus the sides of our triangle are:
      
      \textbf{Side 1.}
      $$76 + 77 + \cdots + 90 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 15 = 1365.$$
      
      \textbf{Side 2.}
      $$16 + 17 + \cdots + 54 = 1365.$$
      
      \textbf{Side 3.}
      $$55 + 56 + \cdots + 75 = 1365.$$
      
      Thus the sum of the shortest rods on each side is $1 + 16 + 55 = 72$.

   \item Let $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1$. For $n > 3$, let $a_n$ be the number of
         real numbers $x$ such that

         Compute the sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_{1000}$.
         
      \textbf{Solution.} We can solve any quartic equation of the form
      $$a_1x^4 + a_2x^2 + a_3 = 0$$
      by making the substitution $y = x^2$, and consequently, reducing it to a
      quadratic equation. So now we shall iteratively compute some of the
      terms in the sequence $\{a_n\}$ in order to exploit any prospective
      repetition. From the

      we see that the terms $a_5$, $a_6$, $\cdots$, $a_{13}$ repeat. We observe
      that there are 9 terms from $a_5$ to $a_{13}$ and that their sum is 21.
      Thus
      \begin{align*}
         \sum_{i=1}^{1000} a_i &= \sum_{i=1}^{4} a_i + \sum_{i=5}^{994} a_i +

   \item Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that
         \begin{equation} \label{8_1}
            \sum_{k=0}^n\log_2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^k}}\right) \ge 1 +
              \log_2\left(\frac{2014}{2015}\right).
         \end{equation}
              
      \textbf{Solution.} Let $n$ be a positive integer. It follows that
      \begin{align*}
         \sum_{k=0}^n\log_2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^k}}\right) &=
            \sum_{k=0}^n\log_2\left(\frac{2^{2^k}+1}{2^{2^k}}\right) \\
            &= \log_2\left(\frac{3}{2^1}\right) +
               \log_2\left(\frac{5}{2^2}\right) + \cdots +
               \log_2\left(\frac{2^{2^n}+1}{2^{2^n}}\right) \\
            &= \log_2\left(\frac{3\cdot5\cdot17\cdots(2^{2^n}+1)}
                  {2^1\cdot\cdot2^2\cdot2^4\cdots2^{2^n}}\right) \\
            &= \log_2\left(\frac{3\cdot5\cdot17\cdots(2^{2^n}+1)}
                  {2^{1+2+4+\cdots+2^n}}\right) \\
            &= \log_2\left(\frac{3\cdot5\cdot17\cdots(2^{2^n}+1)}
                  {2^{2^{n+1}-1}}\right).
      \end{align*}
      In the above notice that $1 + 2 + \cdots + 2^n$ is a geometric sum. So we
      used the following fact: the $m$-th sum of a geometric series with first
      term $a$ and common ration $r$ is given by
      $$\frac{a(r^m - 1)}{r - 1}$$
      to get $1 + 2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{2^{n+1}-1}$. Now we want to find a
      closed form for the expression
      $$f(n) = 3\cdot5\cdot17\cdots(2^{2^n}+1).$$
      We have $f(0) = 3$, $f(1) = 15$, $f(2) = 255$, so we conjecture that
      $f(n) = 2^{2^{n+1}} - 1$. We shall now prove this by induction. It is
      clear that our conjecture holds whenever $n$ is 0, 1, and 2. So assume
      that $f(j) = 2^{2^{j+1}} - 1$ for some positive integer $j$. So we have
      that
      \begin{align*}
         f(j+1) &= 3\cdot5\cdot17\cdots(2^{2^j}+1)\cdot(2^{2^{j+1}}+1) \\
            &= f(j) \cdot (2^{2^{j+1}}+1) \\
            &= (2^{2^{j+1}} - 1)\cdot (2^{2^{j+1}}+1)
               &[\text{Inductive hypothesis}] \\
            &= (2^{2^{j+1}})^2 - 1\\
            &= 2^{2^{(j+1)+1}} - 1.
      \end{align*}
      We have just shown that our conjecture holds for $j + 1$. Thus it follows
      by Mathematical Induction that it holds for all non-negative integers, and
      we have that
      $$\sum_{k=0}^n\log_2\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{2^k}}\right) =
           \log_2\left(\frac{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}{2^{2^{n+1}-1}}\right).$$
           
      Since
      $$1 + \log_2\left(\frac{2014}{2015}\right) = 
        \log_22 + \log_2\left(\frac{2014}{2015}\right) =
              \log_2\left(\frac{4028}{2015}\right),$$
      it follows that \eqref{8_1} holds if and only if
      $$
         \log_2\left(\frac{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}{2^{2^{n+1}-1}}\right) \ge
            \log_2\left(\frac{4028}{2015}\right)
      $$
      if and only if
      $$\frac{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}{2^{2^{n+1}-1}} \ge \frac{4028}{2015}$$
      if and only if
      $$2015(2^{2^{n+1}}-1) \ge 4028(2^{2^{n+1}-1})$$
      if and only if
      $$2015(2^{2^{n+1}}-1) \ge 2014(2^{2^{n+1}})$$
      if and only if
      $$2^{2^{n+1}} \ge 2015$$
      if and only if
      $$n \ge \log_2(\log_22015) - 1.$$
      Thus the smallest $n$ is 3.

   \item In rectangle $WASH$, point $E$ lies on $\overline{SH}$ such that
         $\angle AWS \cong \angle HWE$. Point $D$ lies on $\overline{WS}$ such
         that $\overline{ED} \perp \overline{WS}$. Given that $[WASH] = 100$ and
         $[SED] = 32$, compute $\sin \angle SWE$.

      \textbf{Solution.} We shall use the following labels:
      $$\phi := \angle AWS, w := \overline{AS},\text{ and } h :=\overline{ED}.$$
      So it follows that
      \begin{align*}      
         \angle HWE &= \phi &[\text{Given}] \\
         \angle SWE &= 90 - 2\phi &[\angle HWE + \angle AWS + \angle SWE = 90]\\
         \overline{WA} &= 100 / w &[[WASH] = 100] \\
         \overline{DS} &= 64 / h. &[[SED] = 32]
      \end{align*}
      From $\triangle DWE$, we have that
      \begin{align*}
         \sin \angle DWE &= \sin \angle SWE \\
            &= \sin(90 - 2\phi) \\
            &= \cos2\phi \\
            &= 1 - 2\sin^2\phi.
      \end{align*}
      From $\triangle AWS$, we have that
      \begin{align*}
         \sin^2 \angle AWS &= \sin^2 \phi \\
            &= \frac{\overline{AS}^2}{\overline{WS}^2} \\
            &= \frac{w^2}{w^2 + \D\frac{10000}{w^2}}
                  &[\text{Pythagoras Theorem}] \\
            &= \frac{w^4}{w^4+10000}.
      \end{align*}
      Substitute $\sin^2 \phi = \D\frac{w^4}{w^4+10000}$ in the equation 
      $\sin \angle SWE = 1 - 2\sin^2\phi$ to get
      \begin{equation} \label{9_1}
         \sin \angle SWE = \frac{10000 - w^4}{10000 + w^4}.
      \end{equation}

      Observe the following triangle similarities:
      $$AWS \sim HWE \sim DSE.$$
      We shall exploit these similarities to get
      $$\overline{HE}/\overline{AS} = \overline{HW}/\overline{AW}.$$
      That is, $\overline{HE} = w^3/100$. Similarly
      $$\overline{DE}/\overline{AS} = \overline{DS}/\overline{AW}$$
      and we simplify to get the relation $h = 4w/5$. Applying the Pythagoras
      Theorem to $\triangle SDE$, we get
      \begin{align*}
         \overline{ES} &= \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{4096}{h^2}} \\
            &= \sqrt{\frac{16w^2}{25} + \frac{6400}{w^2}}.
      \end{align*}

      From rectangle $WASH$, we now have that
      $\overline{ES} = \overline{HS} - \overline{HE}$. That is,
      $$\sqrt{\frac{16w^2}{25} + \frac{6400}{w^2}} = \frac{100}{w} -
         \frac{w^3}{100}.$$
      Squaring both sides of the preceding equation and simplifying the
      resulting equation, we shall get
      $$w^8 - 26400w^4 + 36000000 = 0.$$
      Make the substitution $x = w^4$ to reduce the preceding equation to the
      quadratic equation
      $$x^2 - 26400x + 36000000 = 0.$$
      Hence
      \begin{align*}
         x &= \frac{26400 \pm \sqrt{26400^2 - 4 \cdot 36000000}}{2} \\
           &= \frac{26400 \pm \sqrt{552960000}}{2} \\
           &= \frac{26400 \pm 9600\sqrt{6}}{2} \\
           &= 13200 \pm 4800 \sqrt{6}.
      \end{align*}
      Since $\angle SWE$ is an acute angle, $\sin \angle SWE$ must be positive.
      By observing \eqref{9_1} and using the fact that
      $13200 + 4800\sqrt{6} > 10000$, it follows that the only solution is
      $x = 13200 - 4800 \sqrt{6}$. Finally, it follows from \eqref{9_1} and our
      recent results that 
      \begin{align*}
         \sin \angle SWE &= \frac{10000 - w^4}{10000 + w^4} \\
            &= \frac{10000 - x}{10000 + x} \\
            &= \frac{10000 - 13200 + 4800\sqrt{6}}
               {10000 + 13200 - 4800\sqrt{6}} \\
            &= \frac{-3200 + 4800\sqrt{6}}{23200 - 4800\sqrt{6}} \\
            &= \frac{-4 + 6\sqrt{6}}{29 - 6\sqrt{6}} \cdot
               \frac{29 + 6\sqrt{6}}{29 + 6\sqrt{6}} \\
            &= \frac{100 + 150\sqrt{6}}{625} \\
            &= \frac{4 + 6\sqrt{6}}{25}.
      \end{align*}

   \item Six people of different heights are getting in line to buy donuts.
         Compute the number of ways they can arrange themselves in line such
         that no three consecutive people are in increasing order of height,
         from front to back.

      \textbf{Solution.} Let the heights of the six people (in increasing order)
      be $h_1$, $h_2$, $h_3$, $h_4$, $h_5$, and $h_6$. Consider the following
      arrangement:
      $$h_2, h_3, h_1, h_6, h_5, h_4.$$
      We shall say that $h_2$ occupies the first spot, $h_3$ occupies the second
      spot, \ldots, and $h_4$ occupies the sixth spot. We shall regard the first 
      spot to be the front. Now observe that if any arrangement has three
      consecutive people in increasing height, from front to back, then these
      three people must be occupying 
      \begin{itemize}
         \item the first, second, and third spots or
         \item the second, third, and fourth spots or
         \item the third, fourth, and fifth spots or
         \item the fourth, fifth, and sixth spots.
      \end{itemize}
      For $1 \le i \le 4$, let $A_i$ be the number of arrangements such that
      three consecutive people in increasing height, from front to back, are
      occupying the $i$-th, $(i+1)$-th, and $(i+2)$-th spots, and let $A$ be
      the number of arrangements such that three consecutive people are in 
      increasing order of height, from front to back. By our aforementioned
      observation, it follows that
      $$|A| = |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4|.$$
      By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, it follows that
      \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
         |A| & = & |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4| \\
             & = & |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| + |A_4| - \\
             &&   (|A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_1 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_4| +
                   |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_2 \cap A_4| + |A_3 \cap A_4|) + \\
             &&    |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_4| +
                   |A_1 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| + |A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| - \\
             &&    |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4|.
      \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

      We can now compute the following by counting:
      \begin{align*}
         |A_1| &= |A_2| = |A_3| = |A_4| = \binom{6}{3} \cdot 3! = 120, \\
         |A_1 \cap A_2| &= |A_2 \cap A_3| = |A_3 \cap A_4| =
            \binom{6}{4} \cdot 2! = 30, \\
         |A_1 \cap A_3| &= |A_2 \cap A_4| = \binom{6}{5} \cdot 1! = 6, 
         |A_1 \cap A_4| = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \\
         |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| &= |A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| =
            \binom{6}{5} \cdot 1! = 6 \\
         |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_4| &= |A_1 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| =
            |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| = 1.
      \end{align*}

      Thus $|A| = 381$, and we conclude that the number of ways in which no
      three consecutive people are in increasing order of height, from front to 
      back is
      $$6! - |A| = 339.$$
