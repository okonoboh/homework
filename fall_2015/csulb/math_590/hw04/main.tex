   \item Consider the veracity or falsehood of each of the following statements.
         For bonus, argue for those that you believe are true while providing a
         counterexample for those that you believe are false. Work either
         column. These all concern the affine plane (see below) built using a
         field $\F$ with $q$ elements.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item There are $q^2$ points.
            \item There are $q^2 + 1$ lines.
            \item Every line has $q$ points.
            \item Every point is in $q$ lines.
            \item No two lines contain all points.
         \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Answer.}

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item True. There are $q$ choices for each component of a point, for a
               total of $q \cdot q = q^2$ choices.
         \item False. If $\F = \Z_2$, so that $q = 2$, then there are 6, not
               $2^2 + 1 = 5$, lines. See Exercise 3.4 for the lines.
         \item True. If $(c \quad d)$ is a point on the line $\li{1}{x}{k}$,
               where $x, k \in \F$, then it follows that $c + dx = k$, so that
               $c = k - dx$. There are $q$ choices for $d$, and once $d$ is
               chosen, the value of $c$ is automatically determined, so that 
               there are $q$ choices for $(c \quad d)$. Similarly if
               $(c' \quad d')$ is a point on the line $\li{0}{1}{k'}$,
               where $k' \in \F$, then it follows that $d' = k'$, so that there
               are $q$ choices for $(c' \quad d')$ since there are no
               restrictions on $c'$.
         \item False. If $\F = \Z_2$, so that $q = 2$, then we see observe from 
               Exercise 3.4 that the point $(0 \quad 0)$ is on
               three---not 2---lines.
         \item False. If $\F = \Z_2$, then the lines $\li{1}{0}{0}$ and
               $\li{1}{0}{1}$ contain all four points.
      \end{enumerate}   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%02%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item In the last homework you built an extension of the Hamming code using
         columns of size 4 over $\Z_2$. Give the weight enumerator of the code
         that is generated by that matrix---namely it is the row space of the
         matrix---not the null space.

         \textbf{Bonus.} Find the weight enumerator of the Hamming code that is
         the null space of the matrix.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%03%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item \textbf{The Affine Plane.} Let $\textbf{P} = \F^2 =
         \{(a \quad b) : a, b \in \F\}$ be the points in a geometry, where $\F$
         is a field with $q$ elements. Let
         $S = \left\{\col{1}{x}, \col{0}{1} : x \in \F\right\}$ be the set of
         slopes. For any $\textbf{u} \in S$ and any $k \in \F$ define the line
         $\ell(\textbf{u}, k) = \{(a \quad b) : (a \quad b)\textbf{u} = k\}$,
         which is a set of points. Then the set of lines
         $\textbf{L} = \{\ell(\textbf{u}, k) : \textbf{u} \in S, k \in \F\}$.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item Show that every two points are on a unique line.
            \item Show that if $p \in \textbf{P}$ and $\ell \in \textbf{L}$ and
                  $p \notin \ell$, then there exists a unique $\ell_1$ such that
                  $p \in \ell_1$ and $\ell$ and $\ell_1$ are parallel (they do
                  not intersect).
            \item Show there exist 4 points no three of which are collinear (on
                  a line together). \\

                  The three properties above define an \textbf{Affine Plane.}
            \item Give the lines and points when $\F = \Z_2$. \\
            
                  \textbf{Bonus.} Give the lines and points when $\F = GF(4)$.
            \item Use an affine plane to describe how you would solve the
                  following problem that was asked to a member of the department
                  from a professor teaching in the humanities: \\
      
                  \textbf{I currently have 47 students in my class. I am 
                  teaching in a room with cafe tables of 7 per table. If I 
                  wanted to have each student get a chance to meet every other
                  student in the class, how many days would it take and how 
                  would I figure out membership in the groups? I might end up
                  with 52, likely not more. I could fit 8 around a table if need
                  be.}
         \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad d)$ be different 
               points in $\textbf{P}$. We have the following cases:

               \textbf{Case 1.} $b = d$. That is, $(c \quad d) = (c \quad b)$. 
               Since we assumed that points $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad d)$ are 
               different and since $b = d$, it must be the case that $a \neq c$. 
               So suppose that $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad b)$ are on a line
               $\li{0}{1}{k}$, where $k \in \F$. Then it follows that
               $$(a \quad b)\col{0}{1} = b = k = b = (c \quad b)\col{0}{1},$$
               so that the points $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad b)$ are both on 
               the line $\li{0}{1}{b}$. Now suppose to the contrary that, for
               some $x', k' \in \F$, some line $\li{1}{x'}{k'}$ contains
               $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad b)$. It follows by definition that
               $$(a \quad b)\col{1}{x'} = a + bx' = k' = c + bx' =
                 (c \quad d)\col{1}{x'},$$
               so that $a + bx' = c + bx'$, and thus, $a = c$, a contradiction. 
               Thus, the only line that contains $(a \quad b)$ and
               $(c \quad b)$ is $\li{0}{1}{b}$.

               \textbf{Case 2.} $b \neq d$. First we make the observation that
               points $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad d)$ cannot lie on a line
               $\li{0}{1}{k''}$ for some $k'' \in \F$, because that would imply
               that
               $$(a \quad b)\col{0}{1} = b = k'' = d = (c \quad d)\col{0}{1},$$
               a contradiction since $b \neq d$. Now suppose that, for some
               $x, k \in \F$, some line $\li{1}{x}{k}$ contains points
               $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad d)$. It follows by definition that
               $$(a \quad b)\col{1}{x} = a + bx = k = c + dx =
                 (c \quad d)\col{1}{x},$$
               so that $(b - d)x = c - a$. Now since $b \neq d$, it follows that
               $b - d \neq 0$, so that $(b-d)^{-1}$ exists. That is,
               $x = (c - a)(b - d)^{-1}$. Substitute this value of $x$ above to
               get $k = \frac{bc-ad}{b-d}$. So the only line that contains
               points $(a \quad b)$ and $(c \quad d)$ is
               $\li{1}{(c - a)(b - d)^{-1}}{\frac{bc-ad}{b-d}}$. \qed
         \item \textbf{Proof.} Let us make the following observation:
               If $\textbf{v}$ is a slope, then for $i, j \in \F$, with
               $i \neq j$, it follows that $\ell(\textbf{v}, i)$ and
               $\ell(\textbf{v}, j)$ are disjoint. This is so because if
               $(i_1 \quad i_2) \in \ell(\textbf{v}, i)$ and
               $(j_1 \quad j_2) \in \ell(\textbf{v}, j)$, then it follows that
               $$(i_1 \quad i_2)\textbf{v} = i \neq j =
                 (j_1 \quad j_2)\textbf{v}.$$

               Now let $(a \quad b)$ be a point in \textbf{P} and $\ell_1$ a
               line in \textbf{L}. Suppose that $(a \quad b) \notin \ell_1$. 
               Then we have the following cases:

               \textbf{Case 1.} $\ell_1 = \li{0}{1}{k}$, where $k \in \F$ and
               $k \neq b$. The point $(a \quad b)$ does not lie on $\ell_1$
               because $k \neq b$. Let $\ell_2 = \li{0}{1}{b}$ and observe that
               $(a \quad b) \in \ell_2$. Since $k \neq b$ and since $\ell_1$ and
               $\ell_2$ have the same slope, it follows that 
               $\ell_1 \cap \ell_2 = \emptyset$, so that $\ell_1$ and
               $\ell_2$ are parallel.

               \textbf{Case 2.} $\ell_1 = \li{1}{x}{r}$, where $x, r \in \F$ 
               such that $a + bx \neq r$. Let $\ell_2 = \li{1}{x}{a+bx}$. The
               point $(a \quad b)$ does not lie on $\ell_1$ because
               $a + bx \neq r$, but it lies on $\ell_2$. Since $\ell_1$ and
               $\ell_2$ have the same slope and since $a + bx \neq r$, it
               follows that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel.
         \item This is trivially true if $|\F| = 2$ since each line will contain
               exactly two points. So suppose $q = |\F| \ge 3$. The number of 
               lines is $|S| \cdot |\F| = (q+1)q = q^2 + q$.
         \item Let $\F = \Z_2$. Then the points are
               $$(0 \quad 0), (0 \quad 1), (1 \quad 0),
                 \text{ and } (1 \quad 1),$$
               the slopes are
               $$\textbf{u}_1 = \col{1}{0}, \textbf{u}_2 = \col{1}{1},
                 \text{ and } \textbf{u}_3 = \col{0}{1},$$
               and the lines are
               \begin{align*}
                  \ell(\textbf{u}_1, 0) &= \{(0 \quad 0), (0 \quad 1)\} \\
                  \ell(\textbf{u}_1, 1) &= \{(1 \quad 0), (1 \quad 1)\} \\
                  \ell(\textbf{u}_2, 0) &= \{(0 \quad 0), (1 \quad 1)\} \\

                  \ell(\textbf{u}_3, 1) &= \{(0 \quad 1), (1 \quad 1)\}.

               multiplication operations are defined below:

   \item[\textbf{Bonus.}]  \textbf{The Projective Plane.} Let \textbf{P} be the
                           collection of one dimensional subspaces of $\F^3$
                           where $\F$ is a field with $q$ elements. Let
                           $\textbf{L}$ be the collection of two dimensional
                           subspaces of $\F^3$. So
                           $\textbf{P} = \{[z] : z \in \F^3, z \neq 0\}$,
                           $\textbf{L} = \{[z, w] : z, w \in \F^3,
                            \text{independent}\}$. We refer to \textbf{P} as 
                           the points in the geometry and \textbf{L} as the
                           lines, and of course we say point $p$
                           \textbf{is on line} $\ell$ if $p \le \ell$.

      \textbf{Solution.}
      
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item Let $[p]$ and $[r]$ be different points in \textbf{P} ($p \neq 0$
               and $r \neq 0$ because $\dim [p] = \dim [r] = 1$). Since $[p]$
               and $[r]$ are different points, then they must be different one
               dimensional subspaces of $\F^3$. If $p$ is a multiple of $r$,
               then $r$ must also be a multiple of $p$, so that
               $[p] \subseteq [r]$ and $[r] \subseteq [p]$, and thus
               $[p] = [r]$, contradicting our assumption that these two points
               are different. Thus $p$ is not a multiple of $r$; that is,
               $p$ and $r$ are independent, so that $[p, r] \in \textbf{L}$.
               Since $p = 1 \cdot p + 0 \cdot r$ and
               $r = 0 \cdot p + 1 \cdot r$, it follows that both $[p]$ and
               $[r]$ are on the line $[p, r]$. Now suppose that $[p]$ and $[r]$
               lie on some other line $[x, y]$. Then it follows by closure
               under addition and scalar multiplication that
               $[p, r] \le [x, y]$. Note that $\dim [p, r] = \dim [x, y] = 2$.
               That is, a basis for $[p , r]$ is also a basis for $[x, y]$, so
               that $[p, r] = [x, y]$; thus, $[p, r]$ is the unique line that
               contains the points $[p]$ and $[r]$.
         \item Let $[x, y]$ and $[z, w]$ be two different lines in \textbf{L},
               and let $W = [x, y] \cap [z, w]$. To show that the lines $[x, y]$ and $[z, w]$ intersect at a
               unique point, it suffices to show that $\dim W = 1$. Since
               $W \le [x, y]$, it follows by Exercise 1.3 (Homework 3) that
               $\dim W \le \dim [x, y] = 2$. Suppose first that $\dim W = 2$.
               But since $W \le [x, y]$ and $\dim W = \dim [x, y]$, we conclude
               that $W = [x, y]$. Similarly, $W \le [z, w]$ and
               $\dim [z, w] = 2$, so that $W = [x, y] = [z, w]$, contradicting
               our assumption that $[x, y]$ and $[z, w]$ are two different
               lines. Now suppose that $\dim W = 0$. This says that the only
               point that the lines $[x, y]$ and $[z, w]$ have in common is
               $(0, 0, 0)$. Recall that $x$ and $y$ are linearly independent
               and $z$ and $w$ are linearly independent. Thus $\F^3$ has
               four different linearly independent vectors, contradicting the
               fact that it can have at most 3, since $\dim \F^3 = 3$. Hence
               $\dim W > 0$, so that $\dim W = 1$, as desired. \qed
