   \item Consider the veracity or falsehood of each of the following statements.
         For bonus, argue for those that you believe are true while providing a
         counterexample for those that you believe are false. $F$ is a field.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item It is possible for $a + a = 0$ for every $a \in F$ and $F$
                  be infinite.
            \item $|\{a \in \F : a^5 = 1\}| \le 5$.
            \item For any set of real numbers, there is a smallest field of real
                  numbers containing them.

                  where these matrices are seen over $\Z_2$.
         \end{enumerate}
      
      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item True.
   
               \textbf{Example.} Let $F$ be the field of quotients of the
               integral domain $\Z_2[x]$. Clearly $1 \in F$ and $1 + 1 = 0$
               because $1 \in \Z_2$. Thus
               $$a + a = a \cdot (1 + 1) = a \cdot 0 = 0$$
               for all $a \in F$. Finally we observe that $F$ is infinite since
               $\Z_2[x]$ is infinite and $\Z_2[x] \subset F$.
         \item True.

               The statement $|\{a \in F : a^5 = 1\}| \le 5$ is logically
               equivalent to the statement: The binomial $x^5 - 1 \in F[x]$ has 
               at most 5 roots. Instead of proving this specific statement, we 
               shall prove a general one. \\

               \textbf{Lemma 1.1} \textit{The number of roots of a polynomial
               of degree n, with coefficients in a field $F$, is at most n.} \\

               \textbf{Proof.} Let $F$ be a field. We shall proceed by induction 
               on $n$. It is clear that every polynomial of degree 0 (resp. 1)
               has 0 solutions (resp. 1 solution); so our statement is true
               whenever $n$ is 0 or 1. So assume that it is also true for some
               positive integer $k$. Now suppose that $p$ is a polynomial of
               degree $k + 1$, with $p \in F[x]$. If $p$ has no roots, then we
               are done, so we can suppose that $p$ has at least one root, say
               $a$. We can thus use the Division Algorithm to write
               $$p(x) = (x - a)h(x)$$
               where $h$ is a polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $k$. If $b$ is a
               root of $p$ then we must have that $0 = p(b) = (b - a)h(b)$. We
               know that $F[x]$ is an integral domain since $F$ is an integral
               domain; that is, $b - a = 0$ or $h(b) = 0$. This says that a root
               of $p$ must either be a root of the polynomial $x - a$ or the
               polynomial $h$. But our inductive hypothesis says that $h$ must
               have at most $k$ roots, and since we know that $x - a$ has
               exactly one root, it follows that $p$ must have at most $k + 1$
               roots. Thus Lemma 1.1 follows by Mathematical Induction. \qed \\

               Problem 1.2 follows from Lemma 1.1.
         \item True.

               \textbf{Proof.} Let $S$ be a nonempty set of real numbers and let
               $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of subfields of $\R$ that contain $S$.
               The set $\mathcal{F}$ is not empty because $\R \in \mathcal{F}$. 
               Now define
               $$K := \bigcap_{F \in \mathcal{F}}F.$$
               Notice that $K$ is minimal, in that if some field $K'$ contains
               $S$, then $K'$ must also contain $K$. Thus it suffices to show
               that $K$ is a subfield of $\R$. All members of $\mathcal{F}$
               contain 0 and 1 because they are fields; thus $0, 1 \in K$. Now
               let $a, b \in K$. Then $a$ and $b$ are members of all the fields
               in $\mathcal{F}$, so that $a - b$ are also members of these
               fields. Thus $a - b \in K$. That is $(K, +)$ is a subgroup of
               $(\R, +)$. Now let $c$ and $d$ be nonzero members of $K$ (there
               exists at least one, namely the multiplicative identity). By
               considering the multiplicative structure of the fields in
               $\mathcal{F}$, we can similarly argue as we did for the additive
               case that $cd^{-1}$ is a member of all the fields in
               $\mathcal{F}$, so that $cd^{-1} \in K$. That is,
               $(K^*, \cdot)$ is a subgroup of $(\R^*, \cdot)$. So
               we conclude that $K$ is the minimal subfield of $\R$ that
               contains $S$. \qed
         \item False.

               \textbf{Proof.} Suppose $|F| = 8$ and suppose to the contrary
               that $F$ contains a subfield $K$ of order 4. By definition of a
               field, $(F^*, \cdot)$ is a multiplicative group. Similarly
               $(K^*, \cdot)$ is also a multiplicative group. Since every
               element in $K^*$ has a multiplicative inverse and since
               $K \subseteq F$, it follows that $K^* \subseteq F^*$,
               so that $K^* \le F^*$. But $|K^*| = 3 \nmid 7 =
               |F^*|$, a violation of Lagrange's Theorem. So we conclude
               that a field with 8 elements cannot contain a subfield of 4
               elements. \qed
         \item True.
         
               \textbf{Proof.} Let $K = \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3\}$ be an arbitrary
               field where $a_0$ is the additive identity and $a_1$ is the
               multiplicative identity. By definition of a field, we know that
               $\{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$ is a multiplicative group. Thus it follows by
               Lagrange's Theorem that (multiplicative order)
               $|a_2| = |a_3| = 3$. That is,  each of $a_2$ and $a_3$ generates
               the group $\{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$. Hence, since
               $${a_2}^1 = a_2 \text{ and } {a_2}^3 = a_1$$
               it follows that ${a_2}^2 = a_3$. Similarly, ${a_3}^2 = a_2$.
               Now multiply the equality ${a_2}^2 = a_3$ by $a_2$ to conclude
               that $a_2$ and $a_3$ are multiplicative inverses of each other.
               Thus we can fill out the multiplication table for $K$ as follows:
               $$
                  \begin{tabular}{@{}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|
                     >{$}c<{$}|@{}} \hline
                     \cdot & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ \hline
                     a_0 & a_0 & a_0 & a_0 & a_0 \\ \hline
                     a_1 & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ \hline
                     a_2 & a_0 & a_2 & a_3 & a_1 \\ \hline
                     a_3 & a_0 & a_3 & a_1 & a_2 \\ \hline
                  \end{tabular}
               $$
               
               Now we shall the investigate the additive structure of $K$. By
               Lagrange's Theorem, the additive order of 1 is either 2 or 4, but
               since $K$ is a field, we know that the characteristic of $K$ must
               be prime; thus, the additive order of 1 is 2. Now we must have
               that $a + a = a \cdot (1 + 1) = a \cdot 0 = 0$ for all $a \in K$.
               So we can partially fill out a Cayley table for $(K, +)$ as
               follows:
               $$
                  \begin{tabular}{@{}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|
                     >{$}c<{$}|@{}} \hline
                     + & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ \hline
                     a_0 & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ \hline
                     a_1 & a_1 & a_0 &  &  \\ \hline
                     a_2 & a_2 &  & a_0 &  \\ \hline
                     a_3 & a_3 &  &  & a_0 \\ \hline
                  \end{tabular}
               $$
               By using the cancellation laws of groups, we know that every row
               and column of a Cayley table is a permutation of the group
               elements. Hence $a_1 + a_2 = a_2$ or $a_1 + a_2 = a_3$. The
               former implies that $a_1 = a_0$, a contradiction. That is,
               $a_1 + a_2 = a_3$ and $a_1 + a_3 = a_2$. We can use similar
               arguments to fill out the rest of the table to get:
               $$
                  \begin{tabular}{@{}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|>{$}c<{$}|
                     >{$}c<{$}|@{}} \hline

                     a_0 & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ \hline
                     a_1 & a_1 & a_0 & a_3 & a_2  \\ \hline
                     a_2 & a_2 & a_3 & a_0 & a_1 \\ \hline
                     a_3 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 \\ \hline
                  \end{tabular}
               $$
               
               (Alternatively, since $a + a = 0$ for all $a \in K$, we could
               have concluded that $(K, +)$ is the Klein-4 group.)
               Finally let $b_0 = \textbf{0}$, $b_1 = \boldsymbol{I}$, $b_2 =
               \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
                  0 & 1 \\

               \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}

                  1 & 0
               \end{tabular}\right)$, where these matrices are over $\Z_2$. We
               want to show $\{b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3\} \cong
               \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3\}$. The additive and multiplicative
               structures of $\{b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3\}$ can be seen in the tables
               below:

               the tables for the field $K$, then the resulting tables are 
               exactly what we have above. This not only tells us that
               $\{b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3\}$ is a field, but also suggests how to
               construct the desired isomorphism between these two fields. That
               is, we simply define a map that takes $a_i$ to $b_i$, and we are
               done. \qed

         \end{enumerate}
      
      \textbf{Solution.} \\

      \textbf{Lemma 1.2} \textit{If $F$ is a field, then any finite
      multiplicative subgroup of $F$ is cyclic.} \\

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $F'$ be a finite multiplicative subgroup of a field
      $F$. Let $|F'| = m \in \Z^+$. It suffices to show that $F'$ has an element
      of order $m$. Since $F'$ is finite, all its members must have finite
      orders. Let $k$ be the lowest common multiple of all these orders. By
      Lagrange's Theorem, the orders of the elements of $F'$ must also divide
      $m$; that is, $k \mid m$, so that $k \le m$. Since $F'$ is abelian, it  
      follows that there exists an element of order $k$ in $F'$. Now $y^k = 1$ 
      for all $y \in F'$ because $|y|$ divides $k$ for all $y \in F'$. Thus we 
      have just shown that the polynomial $x^k - 1$ (in $F[x]$) has at least $m$ 
      roots. Lemma 1.1 says that $x^k - 1$ can have at most $k$ roots, so that 
      $m \le k$. But we already showed that $k \le m$. Thus $k = m$, and the 
      proof is done. \qed \\


      According to Lemma 1.2, $S$ is cyclic. So we can write
      $$S = \{t^1, t^2, \ldots, t^k\}$$
      for some $t \in S$, where $|t| = k$.

      \begin{enumerate}[start=0, label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item No, $\sigma$ is not in $S$ because $\sigma = 0$ (See \circled{1})
               and 0 has no multiplicative inverse. Yes, $\pi \in S$ because
               $S$ is a multiplicative group and thus closed under
               multiplication.
         \item A quick proof using the Cancellation Laws will show us that the 
               map from $S$ to itself defined by $s \mapsto s_2 \times s$ is 
               injective (and thus bijective since $S$ is finite). Thus the
               multiplication of $\sigma$ by $s_2$ will effect a permutation of
               the terms in the sum $s_1 + s_2 + \cdots + s_k$. But since 
               addition is commutative, we will end up with the same sum. In
               order words $s_2\sigma = \sigma$. Rearranging this equality will 
               give us $\sigma(s_2 - 1) = 0$. Viewing this equation in $F$ and 
               using the fact that $F$ is a integral domain, we must then have 
               that $\sigma = 0$ or $s_2 = 1$. Since the latter is false, we are 
               left with no choice but to conclude that $\sigma = 0$.
         \item Suppose $k$ is odd. By Lagrange's Theorem, it follows that $S$
               has no element of order 2; that is, no non-identity element of
               $S$ is a multiplicative inverse of itself. So we mentally rewrite 
               the product
               $$s_2 \times \cdots \times s_k$$
               by grouping pairs of inverses. Thus $\pi = 1$. 
               Alternatively, we have
               \begin{align*}
                  \pi &= s_1 \times s_2 \times \cdots \times s_k \\
                      &= t^1 \times t^2 \times \cdots \times t^k \\
                      &= t^{1 + 2 + \cdots + k} \\
                      &= t^{^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}}} \\
                      &= (t^k)^{\frac{(k+1)}{2}} &\quad
                        [(k+1)/2 \text{ is an integer since $k$ is odd}] \\
                      &= 1^{^{\frac{k+1}{2}}} = 1.
               \end{align*}
         \item Suppose $k$ is even. Then it follows that $k/2$ is an integer.
               Thus $t^{^{\frac{k^2}{2}}} = (t^k)^{k/2} = 1$. Now
               \begin{align*}
                  \pi &= s_1 \times s_2 \times \cdots \times s_k \\
                      &= t^1 \times t^2 \times \cdots \times t^k \\
                      &= t^{1 + 2 + \cdots + k} \\
                      &= t^{^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}}} \\
                      &= t^{^{\frac{k^2}{2}}}t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}} =
                           t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}.
               \end{align*}

               Clearly $t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}} \neq 1$ because $1 \le k/2 < k$. Also
               we have that $\left(t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}\right)^2 = t^k = 1$, so
               that $\left|t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}\right| = 2$. We now claim that
               $t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}$ is the only element in $S$ of order 2. To
               that end, consider the polynomial $g(x) = x^2 - 1 \in F[x]$. The
               multiplicative identity is clearly a root of $g$. Also,
               $t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}$ is another root of $g$ since its order is 2.
               Lemma 1.1 tells us that these are the only roots of this 
               polynomial. Thus $t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}}$ is the only element of
               multiplicative order 2 in $F$. Thus we can conclude that
               $\pi = t^{^{\frac{k}{2}}} = -1$.
         \item Let $S$ be the multiplicative subgroup of $\C$ consisting of the
               5th roots of unity.. Using the usual notation
               $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$, it follows that
               $$S = \left\{1, e^{^{\frac{2\pi}{5}i}},
                               e^{^{\frac{4\pi}{5}i}},
                               e^{^{\frac{6\pi}{5}i}},
                               e^{^{\frac{8\pi}{5}i}}\right\}.$$
               Thus
               \begin{align*}
                  \pi &= 1 \times
                           e^{^{\frac{2\pi}{5}i}} \times
                           e^{^{\frac{4\pi}{5}i}} \times
                           e^{^{\frac{6\pi}{5}i}} \times
                           e^{^{\frac{8\pi}{5}i}} \\
                      &= 1 \times e^{^{\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}+\frac{4\pi}{5}+
                              \frac{6\pi}{5}+\frac{8\pi}{5}\right)i}} \\
                      &= 1 \times e^{^{4\pi i}} = 1 \times 1 = 1.
               \end{align*}
         \item Now let $S$ be the multiplicative subgroup of $\C$ consisting of 
               the 4th roots of unity. Thus
               $$S = \left\{1, e^{^{\frac{\pi}{2}i}},
                               e^{^{\pi i}},
                               e^{^{\frac{3\pi}{2}i}}\right\}$$
               and, consequently,
               \begin{align*}
                  \pi &= 1 \times
                           e^{^{\frac{\pi}{2}i}} \times
                           e^{^{\pi i}} \times
                           e^{^{\frac{3\pi}{2}i}} \\
                      &= 1 \times e^{^{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+ \pi+
                              \frac{3\pi}{2}\right)i}} \\
                      &= 1 \times e^{^{3\pi i}} = e^{^{\pi i}} = -1.
               \end{align*}

               $C$ is the $j$-th column of $M$---the matrix from
               \circled{3}---or it is the negative of the $j$-th column of $M$. 
               In the former case, the odd ball is heavier than the rest, while  
               it is lighter than the rest in the latter case. In either case, 
               the $j$-th ball is the odd one out.
