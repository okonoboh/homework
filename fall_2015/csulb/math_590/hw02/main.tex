   \item Consider the veracity or falsehood of each of the following statements.
         For bonus, argue for those that you believe are true while providing a
         counterexample for those that you believe are false. Here $A$ and $B$
         are adjacency matrices of graphs.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item $AB$ is a symmetric matrix.
            \item $A$ is regular if and only if $AJ = kJ$ for some constant $k$.
            \item $A^2 + I$ is invertible.
            \item $AJ = JA$ implies $A$ is regular.
            \item If $A$ is connected and $AJ = 3J$, then 3 only occurs once as
                  an eigenvalue of $A$.

   \item \textbf{On Graphs \& Their Automorphisms.} Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph.
         Thus $V$ is the (finite) set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges,
         and we are assuming the relation is symmetric and irreflexive: if
         $x \sim y$ then $y \sim x$, and $x \not\sim x$. A permutation or
         bijection $\alpha : V \rightarrow V$ is said to be an automorphism of
         $G$ if whenever $x \sim y$ then $\alpha(x) \sim \alpha(y)$. Let
         Aut($G$) denote the set of automorphisms.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item Prove Aut($G$) is a subgroup of the group of permutations of
                  $V$.
            \item Show that for any two vertices, $x, y \in V$, if there exists
                  $\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)$ such that $\alpha(x) = y$, then
                  they have the same degree---namely the number of edges coming
                  out of each is the same.
         \end{enumerate}
         
      \textbf{Proof.}

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item The set $\text{Aut}(G)$ is not empty since it contains the
               identity permutation---the permutation that fixes all vertices of
               $V$. Associativity is already taken care of because the group of
               permutations is associative under function composition; the
               identity permutation serves as the identity for Aut($G$), and
               since Aut($G$) is finite, it is also closed under taking
               inverses. So we only need to show closure under function
               composition. To that end, let
               $\beta, \gamma \in \text{Aut}(G)$. Suppose we have $x \sim y$ for
               some $x, y \in V$. Since $\gamma$ is a member of Aut($G$), it
               follows that $\gamma(x) \sim \gamma(y)$. Similarly, since
               $\gamma(x)$ and $\gamma(y)$ are members of $V$, it follows that
               $\beta(\gamma(x)) \sim \beta(\gamma(y))$, so that
               $(\beta\circ\gamma)(x) \sim (\beta\circ\gamma)(y)$; that is,
               $\beta\circ\gamma \in \text{Aut}(G)$, and so we conclude that
               $\text{Aut}(G) \le S_V$.
         \item Let $S_v = \{u \in V: u \sim v\}$, where $v \in V$. It is clear
               that for $v \in V$, we have $\text{degree($v$)} = |S_v|$. Now
               suppose that there exist $x, y \in V$ and
               $\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)$ such that $\alpha(x) = y$. We want to
               show that degree($x$) = degree($y$); that is, $|S_x| = |S_y|$.
               Assume that $S_x$ is not empty. So let
               $a \in S_x$, so that $x \sim a$. It follows that
               $y = \alpha(x) \sim \alpha(a)$; that is, $\alpha(a) \in S_y$.
               Since $\alpha$ is injective, it must therefore map all elements
               of $S_x$ to unique elements in $S_y$; thus $|S_x| \le |S_y|$.
               Now let $b \in S_y$, so that $y \sim b$; recall that Aut($G$) is
               a group, so we must have $\alpha^{-1} \in \text{Aut}(G)$. Thus
               since $y \sim b$, it follows that
               $x = \alpha^{-1}(y) \sim \alpha^{-1}(b)$, so that
               $\alpha^{-1}(b) \in S_x$. Similarly, we conclude that
               $\alpha^{-1}$ maps elements of $S_y$ to unique elements in $S_x$
               because it is injective. Thus $|S_y| \le |S_x|$ and we conclude
               that $|S_x| = |S_y|$, so that degree($x$) = degree($y$). Now if
               $S_x$ is empty, then our arguments above show us that $S_y$ must
               also be empty (since the preimage of the elements of $S_y$ under
               $\alpha$ are precisely the elements of $S_x$), and the proof is
               complete.\qed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%03%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item We are going to describe a graph with 50 vertices. The vertices $V$ are
         simply the following $(a \quad b)$ and $\col{a}{b}$ where
         $a, b \in \Z_5$. Recall that the squares $\S$ in $\Z_5$ are $\{1, 4\}$
         and the non-squares $\N$ are $\{2, 3\}$. Observe $-\S = \S$ and
         $-\N = \N$. We now describe the edges:

         $(a \quad b) \sim (c \quad d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and
         $b - d \in \S$. Note this is symmetric. $\col{a}{b} \sim \col{c}{d}$
         if and only if $a = c$ and $b - d \in \N$. Note this is symmetric.
         $(a \quad b) \sim \col{c}{d}$ if and only if
         $\col{c}{d} \sim (a \quad b)$ if and only if $b = ca + d$. Since
         $0 \notin \S \cup \N$, the relation is irreflexive so we have a
         graph $G$. Let $A$ be its $50 \times 50$ adjacency matrix. Do the
         following:

         \begin{enumerate}[start=0, label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item Find the vertices connected to $(0 \quad 0)$.
                  \textbf{Hint.} Do it by cases.
            \item Find the vertices connected to $\col{0}{0}$.
            \item Show the mapping $\alpha_x : V \rightarrow V$ defined by
                  $(a \quad b) \mapsto (a \quad b + x)$ and
                  $\col{c}{d} \mapsto \col{c}{d+x}$ is an automorphism of the
                  graph.
            \item Let $m \neq 0 \in \Z_5$. Show that the mapping
                  $\beta_m(a \quad b) = (ma \quad b)$ and
                  $\col{c}{d} = \col{m^{-1}c}{d}$ is an automorphism of the
                  graph.
            \item Show that $AJ = kJ$ for some $k$ and find the $k$.
            \item Show that if $(a \quad b) \sim (c \quad d)$, or
                  $\col{a}{b} \sim \col{c}{d}$, or
                  $(a \quad b) \sim \col{c}{d}$, then there is no vertex joined
                  to both. \textbf{Hint.} Do cases.
            \item Show that if $(a \quad b) \not\sim (c \quad d)$, or
                  $\col{a}{b} \not\sim \col{c}{d}$, or
                  $(a \quad b) \not\sim\col{c}{d}$, then there is exactly one
                  vertex joined to both.
            \item Show there exist integers $m, n, l$ such that   
                  $A^2 = mA + nI + lJ$ and find them.
            \item Find the spectrum of the graph. \textbf{Hint.} Use the
                  spectrum of $J$ and the fact that the spectrum of a polynomial
                  is the polynomial of the spectrum, and use the trace.
         \end{enumerate}
         
      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}[start=0, label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item Suppose that $(0 \quad 0) \sim (a \quad b)$ and
               $(0 \quad 0)\sim \col{c}{d}$. It follows that $a = 0$ and
               $b - 0 = b \in \S$ and $0 = 0 + d$. Thus the vertices
               connected to $(0 \quad 0)$ are:
               $$(0 \quad 1), (0 \quad 4), \col{0}{0}, \col{1}{0}, \col{2}{0},
               \col{3}{0}, \text{ and }\col{4}{0}.$$
         \item Now suppose that $\col{0}{0} \sim (a \quad b)$ and 
               $\col{0}{0} \sim \col{c}{d}$. Then it follows that
               $b = 0 \cdot a + 0 = 0$, $c = 0$, and $d - 0 = d \in \N$. Thus
               the vertices connected to $(0 \quad 0)$ are:
               $$(0 \quad 0), (1 \quad 0), (2 \quad 0), (3 \quad 0),
                 (4 \quad 0), \col{0}{2}, \text{ and } \col{0}{3}.$$
      \end{enumerate}

   \item[\textbf{Bonus.}]  Let $G$ be a connected graph. If for any two vertices
                           $x, y \in V$, there exists $\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)$
                           such that $\alpha(x) = y$, then we say the group of
                           automorphisms is \textbf{vertex transitive}.

                           \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]   
                              \item Prove that if $\text{Aut}(G)$ is vertex
                                    transitive, then the graph is regular,
                                    namely the number of edges leaving a vertex
                                    is the same for any two vertices. Assume
                                    vertex transitivity. Then $\text{Aut}(G)$ is
                                    \textbf{edge transitive} when for any pairs
                                    of points, $x_1 \sim y_1$ and $x_2 \sim y_2$
                                    there exists $\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)$ such
                                    that $\alpha(x_1) = x_2$ and
                                    $\alpha(x_2) = y_2$.
                              \item Prove that if $\text{Aut}(G)$ is
                                    \textbf{edge transitive}, and if
                                    $x_1 \not\sim y_1$ and $x_2 \not\sim y_2$,
                                    there exists $\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)$ such
                                    that $\alpha(x_1) = x_2$ and
                                    $\alpha(x_2) = y_2$.
                              \item Prove that if $\text{Aut}(G)$ is edge
                                    transitive, and $A$ is the adjacency matrix
                                    of the graph, then there exist integers
                                    $a, b, c$ such that $A^2 = aA + bI +cJ$.
                              \item Decide if the graph in the previous problem
                                    has a vertex transitive group or an edge
                                    transitive group.
