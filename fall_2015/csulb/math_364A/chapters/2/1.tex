In Problems 1, 3, 7, 8, and 11, find the general solution of the differential
equation, and use it to determine how solutions behave as
$t \rightarrow \infty$.
\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.1.1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.1.1]   $y' + 3y = t + e^{-2t}$.

      \textbf{Solution.} Multiply the equation above by the integrating factor
      $e^{\int 3\;dt} = e^{3t}$ to get
      $$e^{3t}y' + 3e^{3t}y = te^{3t} + e^t,$$
      so that
      $$(ye^{3t})' = te^{3t} + e^t.$$
      Differentiate the preceding equation to get
      $$ye^{3t} = \int (te^{3t} + e^t)\;dt = \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}(3t - 1) + e^t +
        C.$$
      That is, $y(t) = \frac{1}{9}(3t - 1) + e^{-2t} + Ce^{-3t}$, and
      $y \rightarrow \infty$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.1.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.1.3]   $y' + y = te^{-t} + 1$.

      \textbf{Solution.} The integrating factor is $e^{\int dt} = e^t$. Now
      multiply the differential equation by $e^t$ to get
      $$e^ty' + e^ty = t + e^t,$$
      so that
      $$(e^ty)' = t + e^t.$$
      That is $e^ty = \int(t + e^t) = \frac{1}{2}t^2 + e^t + C$, and we conclude
      that $y(t) = \frac{1}{2}e^{-t}(t^2 + C') + 1$, and $y \rightarrow 1$ as
      $t \rightarrow \infty$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.1.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.1.7]   $y' + 2ty = 2te^{-t^2}$.

      \textbf{Solution.} The integrating factor is
      $e^{\int 2t\;dt} = e^{t^2}$. Multiply by the integrating factor
      to transform the equation into
      $$(e^{t^2}y)' = 2t.$$
      Integrate and simplify to get $y(t) = e^{-t^2}(t^2 + C)$, and thus,
      $y \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.1.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.1.8]   $(1 + t^2)y' + 4ty = (1 + t^2)^{-2}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} First we rewrite the equation in standard form to get:
      $$y' + \frac{4t}{1+t^2}y = (1 + t^2)^{-3}.$$
      The integrating factor is thus $e^{\int((4t/1+t^2))\;dt} = (1 + t^2)^2$.
      So multiply the standard form by the integrating factor to get
      $$(y(1+t^2)^2)' = (1+t^2)^{-1}.$$
      Now integrate and simplify to get
      $$y(t) = \frac{\arctan(t)}{(1+t^2)^2} + \frac{C}{(1+t^2)^2}.$$
      Thus $y \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.1.11%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.1.11]  $y' + y = 5\sin(2t)$.
