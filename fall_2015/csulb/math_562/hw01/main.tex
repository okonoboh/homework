%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.2.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.2.3.]  Show from the definition that the functions $x = \text{Re }z$
                  and $y = \text{Im }z$ are not complex differentiable at any 
                  point.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.2.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.2.5.]  Show that if $f$ is analytic on $D$, then
                  $g(z) = \overline{f(\overline{z})}$ is analytic on the
                  reflected domain $D^* = \{\overline{z} : z \in D\}$, and
                  $g'(z) = \overline{f'(\overline{z})}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.3.]  Show that if $f$ and $\overline{f}$ are both analytic on a
                  domain $D$, then $f$ is constant.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.4.]  Show that if $f$ is analytic on a domain $D$, and if $|f|$ is
                  constant, then $f$ is constant. \textit{Hint.} Write
                  $\overline{f} = |f|^2/f$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%2.3.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[2.3.6.]  If $f = u + iv$ is analytic on $D$, then $\nabla v$ is
                  obtained by rotating $\nabla u$ by $90^\circ$. In particular,
                  $\nabla u$ and $\nabla v$ are orthogonal.
