   \item[4.1.2]   Let $G$ be a \textit{permutation group} on the set $A$
                  (i.e., $G \le S_A$), let $\sigma \in G$ and let $a \in A$.
                  Prove that $\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} = G_{\sigma(a)}$. Deduce
                  that if $G$ acts transitively on $A$ then
                  $$\bigcap_{\sigma \in G}\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} = 1.$$
                  
      \textbf{Proof.} $(\subseteq):$ Let $\gamma \in \sigma G_a\sigma^{-1}$.
      Then $\gamma = \sigma \beta\sigma^{-1}$ for some $\beta \in G_a$. So we
      have that
      \begin{align*}
         \gamma(\sigma(a)) = (\sigma \beta\sigma^{-1})(\sigma(a)) &=
            (\sigma \beta)(\sigma^{-1}(\sigma(a))) \\
            &= (\sigma \beta)((\sigma^{-1}\sigma)(a)) \\
            &= (\sigma \beta)(a) \\
            &= \sigma(\beta(a)) \\
            &= \sigma(a),  & [\beta \in G_a]
      \end{align*}
      so that $\gamma \in G_{\sigma(a)}$, and thus,
      $\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} \subseteq G_{\sigma(a)}$.
      
      $(\supseteq)$: Let $\alpha \in G_{\sigma(a)}$. Since
      \begin{align*}
         (\sigma^{-1}\alpha\sigma)(a) &= \sigma^{-1}((\alpha\sigma)(a)) \\
            &= \sigma^{-1}(\alpha(\sigma(a))) \\
            &= \sigma^{-1}(\sigma(a)) &[\alpha \in G_{\sigma(a)}] \\
            &= (\sigma^{-1}\sigma)(a) \\
            &= a,
      \end{align*}
      it follows that $\sigma^{-1}\alpha\sigma \in G_a$. Hence
      $$\alpha = \sigma(\sigma^{-1}\alpha\sigma)\sigma^{-1} \in \sigma
        G_a\sigma^{-1},$$
      so that $\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} \supseteq G_{\sigma(a)}$, and we conclude
      that $\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} = G_{\sigma(a)}$.

      Now suppose that $G$ acts transitively on $A$. This implies that if
      $b \in A$, then there is a permutation in $G$ that maps $a$ to $b$. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         \bigcap_{\sigma \in G}\sigma G_a\sigma^{-1} &=
            \bigcap_{\sigma \in G} G_{\sigma(a)} \\
            &= \bigcap_{b \in A} G_b \\
            &= \text{Kernel of the action of $G$ on $A$} \\
            &= 1.
      \end{align*}
      The last equality follows because the trivial permutation is the only
      permutation in $S_A$ that fixes all elements of $A$. \qed

   \item[4.1.3]   Assume that $G$ is an abelian, transitive subgroup of $S_A$.
                  Show that $\sigma(a) \neq a$ for all $\sigma \in G - \{1\}$
                  and all $a \in A$. Deduce that $|G| = |A|$. [Use the preceding
                  exercise.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%4.1.08%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[4.1.8]   A transitive permutation group $G$ on a set $A$ is called
                  \textit{doubly transitive} if for any (hence all) $a \in A$
                  the subgroup $G_a$ is transitive on the set $A - \{a\}$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $S_n$ is doubly transitive on
                           $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ for all $n \ge 2$.
                     \item Prove that a doubly transitive group is primitive.
                           Deduce that $D_8$ is not doubly transitive in its
                           action on the 4 vertices of a square.

   \item[4.2.4]   Use the left regular representation of $Q_8$ to produce two
                  elements of $S_8$ which generate a subgroup of $S_8$
                  isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%4.2.07%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[4.2.7]   Let $Q_8$ be the quaternion group of order 8.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that $Q_8$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of
                           $S_8$.
                     \item Prove that $Q_8$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of
                           $S_n$ for any $n \le 7$. [If $Q_8$ acts on any set
                           $A$ of order $\le 7$ show that the stabilizer of any
                           point $a \in A$ must contain the subgroup
                           $\cyc{-1}$.]

   \item[4.2.10]  Prove that every non-abelian group of order 6 has a nonnormal
                  subgroup of order 2. Use this to classify groups of order 6.
