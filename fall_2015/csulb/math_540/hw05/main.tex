%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.02%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.2]   Let $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism of groups 
                  with kernel $K$ and let $a, b \in \varphi(G)$. Let $X \in G/K$ 
                  be the  fiber above $a$ and let $Y$ be the fiber above $b$, 
                  i.e., $X = \varphi^{-1}(a)$, $Y = \varphi^{-1}(b)$. Fix an 
                  element $u$ of $X$ (so $\varphi(u) = a$). Prove that if
                  $XY = Z$ in the quotient group $G/K$ and $w$ is any member of 
                  $Z$, then there is some $v \in Y$ such that $uv = w$.
                  [Show $u^{-1}w \in Y$.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.09%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.9]   Define $\varphi : \C^\times \rightarrow \R^\times$ by
                  $\varphi(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2$. Prove that $\varphi$ is a
                  homomorphism and find the image of $\varphi$. Describe the
                  kernel and the fibers of $\varphi$ geometrically (as subsets
                  of the plane).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.16%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.16]  Let $G$ be a group, let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and
                  let $\overline{G} = G/N$. Prove that if $G = \cyc{x, y}$ then
                  $\overline{G} = \cyc{\overline{x}, \overline{y}}$. Prove more
                  generally that if $G = \cyc{S}$ for any subset $S$ of $G$,
                  then $\overline{G} = \cyc{\overline{S}}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.22%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.22]  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that if $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of a
                           group $G$ then their intersection $H \cap K$ is also
                           a normal subgroup of $G$.
                     \item Prove that the intersection of an arbitrary nonempty
                           collection of normal subgroups of a group is a normal
                           subgroup (do not assume the collection is countable).
                  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.24%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.24]  Prove that if $N \trianglelefteq G$ and $H$ is any subgroup of
                  $G$ then $N \cap H \trianglelefteq H$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.26%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.26]  Let $a, b \in G$.
                  \begin{enumerate}
                     \item Prove that the conjugate of the product of $a$ and
                           $b$ is the product of the conjugate of $a$ and the
                           conjugate of $b$. Prove that the order of $a$ and the
                           order of any conjugate of $a$ are the same.
                     \item Prove that the conjugate of $a^{-1}$ is the inverse
                           of the conjugate of $a$.
                     \item Let $N = \cyc{S}$ for some subset $S$ of $G$. Prove
                           that $N \trianglelefteq G$ if $gSg^{-1} \subseteq N$
                           for all $g \in G$.
                     \item Deduce that if $N$ is the cyclic group $\cyc{x}$,
                           then $N$ is normal in $G$ if and only if for each
                           $g \in G$, $gxg^{-1} = x^k$ for some $k \in \Z$.
                     \item Let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that the
                           subgroup $N$ of $G$ generated by all the elements of
                           $G$ of order $n$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
                  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.36%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.36]  Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian. [If
                  $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic with generator $xZ(G)$, show that every
                  element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^az$ for some
                  integer $a \in \Z$ and some element $z \in Z(G)$.]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3.1.41%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.1.41]  Let $G$ be a group. Prove that
                  $N = \cyc{x^{-1}y^{-1}xy : x, y \in G}$ is a normal subgroup
                  of $G$ and $G/N$ is abelian ($N$ is called the
                  \textit{commutator subgroup} of $G$).
