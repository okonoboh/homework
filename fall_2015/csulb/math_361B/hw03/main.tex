   \item[10.14.]  Let $(S, d)$ be a metric space. Show that $x_0$ is a limit
                  point of $A \subseteq S$ if and only if every sphere centered
                  at $x_0$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $x_0$ and $A \subseteq S$. ($\Rightarrow$) We shall
      instead prove the contrapositive of the forward direction; that is, we
      want to show that if there exists some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that
      $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$ contains finitely many points of $A$, then $x_0$ is
      not a limit point of $A$. If $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$ contains no points of
      $A$, then it follows by definition that $x_0$ is not a limit point of $A$,
      so assume that for some positive integer $n$, $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$
      contains $n$ points of $A$ (all different from $x_0$), say points $p_1$,
      $p_2$, $\ldots$, $p_n$. Let
      $$m = \min\{d(p_i, x_0) : i = 1, 2, \ldots, n\}.$$
      First we observe that $m > 0$ because all the points are different from
      $x_0$; now observe that $S_{m/2}(x_0)$ contains no points of $A$ since the
      closest point of $A$ is at a distance of $m$ from $x_0$. Thus, it follows
      that $x_0$ is not a limit point of $A$, and we conclude by the
      equivalent contrapositive that if $x_0$ is a limit of $A \subseteq S$,
      then every sphere centered at $x_0$ contains infinitely many points of
      $A$.
      
      ($\Leftarrow$) Now suppose that every sphere centered at $x_0$ contains
      infinitely many points of $A$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By
      hypothesis, we have that $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$ contains infinitely many
      points of $A$; thus, $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$ contains at least 1 point of $A$
      that is different from $x_0$, so that $S_\varepsilon(x_0)$ contains at
      least 1 point of $A$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$. That is, $x_0$ is a limit
      point of $A$ by definition. \\
      
      So conclude that  $x_0$ is a limit point of $A \subseteq S$ if and only if
      every sphere centered at $x_0$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.
      \qed
