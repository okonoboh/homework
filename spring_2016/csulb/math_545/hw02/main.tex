Let $R$ be a ring.
\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%03%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[3.]   Prove that if $M$ is an $R$-module, then
               $$r(-m) = -r(m) = -(rm)$$
               for all $r \in R$ and $m \in M$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $M$ be an $R$-module and consider $r \in R$ and
      $m \in M$. We will first show that for every $x \in R$, we have
      $x \cdot 0 = 0$, where $0 \in M$. So let $x \in R$. Then since
      \begin{align*}
         0 + x \cdot 0 &= x \cdot 0 \\
                   &= x \cdot (0 + 0) &[0 \text{ is additive identity in }M] \\
                   &= x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0, &[\text{Distributivity}]
      \end{align*}
      it follows by cancellation that $x \cdot 0 = 0$. Thus it follows that
      \begin{align*}
         -(rm) + rm &= 0 \\
           &= r \cdot 0 \\
           &=  r((-m) + m) \\
           &= r(-m) + rm. &[\text{Distributivity}]
      \end{align*}
      That is, $-(rm) + rm = r(-m) + rm$, and conclude by cancellation that
      $-(rm) = r(-m)$. Next, we will show that $(-1)y = -y$ for every $y \in R$.
      So let $y \in R$. Since
      \begin{align*}
         (-1)y + y &= (-1)y + (1)y \\
            &= ((-1) + 1)y &[\text{Distributivity}] \\
            &= 0 \cdot y \\
            &= 0 & [\text{From }1.1]\\
            &= -y + y,
      \end{align*}
      it follows by cancellation that $(-1)y = -y$. Finally, we have that
      \begin{align*}
         -r(m) &= (-r)(m) \\
               &= [(-1)r](m) \\
               &= (-1)(rm) &[\text{Associativity}] \\
               &= -(rm),
      \end{align*}
      so that
      $$-r(m) = -(rm) = r(-m),$$
      as desired. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%04%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[4.]   Show that if $N$ is a nonempty subset of an $R$-module $M$, then
               $$\text{Ann}({N}) = \{r \in R : rn = 0
                 \text{ for all }n \in N\}$$
               is an ideal of $R$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $N$ be a nonempty subset of an $R$-module $M$. Since
      $0 \cdot n = 0$ for all $n \in N$, it follows immediately that
      $0 \in \text{Ann}(N)$, so that Ann($N$) is nonempty. Now let
      $x, y \in \text{Ann}(N)$ and $t \in N$. It suffices to show that Ann($N$)
      is closed under subtraction and multiplication by $R$. 
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{closure under subtraction.} Since
               $x, y \in \text{Ann}(N)$, we have $xt = yt = 0$. That is,
               $(x - y)t = xt - yt = 0 - 0 = 0$, so that
               $x - y \in \text{Ann}(N)$. Hence, Ann($N$) is closed under
               subtraction.
         \item \textbf{closure under multiplication by $R$.} Let $r \in R$. So
               we have that $(rx)t = r(xt) = r\cdot 0 = 0$, so that
               $rx \in \text{Ann}(N)$; i.e., Ann($N$) is closed under
               multiplication by $R$.
      \end{itemize}
      Conclude that Ann($N$) is an ideal of $R$. Let $m \in M$. The statement
      preceding 4.2 (Page 14 in A\&K) follows because we just showed that
      Ann($m$) (which is equal to Ann($\{m\}$) and Ann($M$) are ideals of $R$.
      \qed

   \item[5.]   Prove that if $M$ and $N$ are $R$-modules then
               $M \oplus N$ is an $R$-module.

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $M$ and $N$ are $R$-modules. By Exercises 28
      and 29 from Section 1.1 in Dummit and Foote, it follows that $M \oplus N$
      is an abelian group. It remains to show that $M \oplus N$ is closed under
      scalar multiplication by $R$, is distributive, is associative, and is
      unitary. So let $x, y \in R$ and $a, b \in M \oplus N$. Then $a = (m, n)$
      and $b = (m', n')$ for some $m, m' \in M$ and $n, n' \in N$. So 
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{closed under scalar multiplication.} Since $M$ and $N$
               are $R$-modules, it follows that $xm \in M$ and $xn \in N$; thus,
               $xa = x(m, n) = (xm, xn) \in M \oplus N$, so that $M \oplus N$
               is closed under scalar multiplication by $R$.
         \item \textbf{distributive.} This follows because
               \begin{align*}
                  x(a + b) &= x((m, n) + (m', n')) \\
                     &= x(m + m', n + n') &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= (x(m + m'), x(n + n')) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= (xm + xm', xn + xn')
                        &[M\text{ and }N \text{ are } R\text{-modules}] \\
                     &= (xm, xn) + (xm', xn') &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= x(m, n) + x(m', n') &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= xa + xb
               \end{align*}
               and
               \begin{align*}
                  (x + y)a &= (x + y)(m, n) \\
                     &= ((x + y)m, (x + y)n) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= (xm + ym, xn + yn)
                        &[M\text{ and }N \text{ are } R\text{-modules}] \\
                     &= (xm, xn) + (ym, yn) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= x(m, n) + y(m, n) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= xa + ya.
               \end{align*}
         \item \textbf{associative.} This follows because
               \begin{align*}
                  x(ya) &= x(y(m, n)) \\
                     &= x(ym, yn) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= (x(ym), x(yn)) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= ((xy)m, (xy)n) 
                        &[M\text{ and }N \text{ are } R\text{-modules}] \\
                     &= (xy)(m, n) &[\text{Definition}] \\
                     &= (xy)a.
               \end{align*}
         \item \textbf{unitary.} This follows since
               $$1\cdot a = 1(m, n) = (1 \cdot m, 1 \cdot n) = (m, n) = a.$$
      \end{itemize}
      So conclude that $M \oplus N$ is an $R$-module. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%06%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.]   Prove ``is an isomorphism to" (for modules) is an equivalence
               relation.

      \textbf{Proof.} Let $\mathscr{X}$ be the set of all $R$-modules. The set
      $\mathscr{X}$ is nonempty because $R \in \mathscr{X}$. Now define a
      relation $\mathcal{R}$ on $\mathscr{X}$ such that if
      $M, N \in \mathscr{X}$ then $(M, N) \in \mathcal{R}$ if and only if $M$
      and $N$ are isomorphic. We will now show that $\mathcal{R}$ is an
      equivalence relation on $\mathscr{X}$.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{reflexivity.} Let $M \in \mathscr{X}$ and let
               $i : M \rightarrow M$ be the identity function. Since
               $$i(m_1 + m_2) = m_1 + m_2 = i(m_1) + i(m_2)$$
               and
               $i(rm_1) = rm_1 = ri(m_1)$ for all $r \in R$ and
               $m_1, m_2 \in M$, it follows that $i$ is an $R$-module
               homomorphism. Since $i$ is the identity on $M$, it is trivially
               bijective. Thus $i$ is an $R$-module isomorphism, so that $M$ is
               isomorphic to $M$; i.e., $(M, M) \in \mathcal{R}$ and thus
               $\mathcal{R}$ is reflexive.
         \item \textbf{symmetry.} Suppose that $(M, N) \in \mathcal{R}$ for some
               $M, N \in \mathscr{X}$. That is, there exists an $R$-module
               isomorphism $\alpha : M \rightarrow N$. Since $\alpha$ is
               bijective, it has a unique and well defined inverse,
               $\alpha^{-1} : N \rightarrow M$ (where $\alpha^{-1}(a) = b$ if
               and only if $\alpha(b) = a$), which is also bijective. Now it
               suffices to show that $\alpha^{-1}$ is also an $R$-module
               homomorphism. Let $n_1, n_2 \in N$. Since $\alpha$ is bijective,
               there exist unique $m_1, m_2 \in M$ such that $\alpha(m_1) = n_1$
               and $\alpha(m_2) = n_2$.
               \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textbf{Show that } $\alpha^{-1}$
                        \textbf{is a group homomorphism.} We have
                        \begin{align*}
                           n_1 + n_2 &= \alpha(m_1) + \alpha(m_2) \\
                              &= \alpha(m_1 + m_2), &[\alpha \text{ is a
                                 group homomorphism}]
                        \end{align*}
                        and thus 
                        $$\alpha^{-1}(n_1 + n_2) = m_1 + m_2 =
                          \alpha^{-1}(n_1) + \alpha^{-1}(n_2),$$
                        so that $\alpha^{-1}$ is also a group homomorphism.
                  \item \textbf{Show that }
                        $\alpha^{-1}(rn_1) = r\alpha^{-1}(n_1)$ for all
                        $r \in R$. Let $r \in R$. We have
                        \begin{align*}
                           \alpha(rm_1) &= r\alpha(m_1) 
                              &[\alpha \text{ is an }R
                                \text{-module homomorphism}] \\
                              &= rn_1,
                        \end{align*}
                        so that $\alpha^{-1}(rn_1) = rm_1 = r\alpha^{-1}(n_1)$.
               \end{itemize}
               Thus conclude that $\alpha^{-1}$ is an $R$-module isomorphism.
               That is, $(N, M) \in \mathcal{R}$, so that $\mathcal{R}$ is
               symmetric.
         \item \textbf{transitivity.} Suppose that $(M, N) \in \mathcal{R}$ and
               $(N, T) \in \mathcal{R}$ for some $M, N, T \in \mathscr{X}$.
               That is, there exist $R$-module isomorphisms
               $\alpha : M \rightarrow N$ and $\beta : N \rightarrow T$. We
               claim that $\beta\circ\alpha : M \rightarrow T$ is also an
               $R$-module isomorphisms. The map $\beta\circ\alpha$ is bijective
               because the composition of bijective functions is also bijective.
               Now let $m_1, m_2 \in M$.
               \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textbf{Show that } $\beta\circ\alpha$
                        \textbf{is a group homomorphism.} We have
                        \begin{align*}
                           (\beta\circ\alpha)(m_1 + m_2) &=
                              \beta(\alpha(m_1 + m_2)) \\
                              &= \beta(\alpha(m_1) + \alpha(m_2))
                                 &[\alpha \text{ is a group homomorphism}] \\
                              &= \beta(\alpha(m_1)) + \beta(\alpha(m_2))
                                 &[\beta \text{ is a group homomorphism}] \\
                              &= (\beta\circ\alpha)(m_1)) +
                                    (\beta\circ\alpha)(m_2),
                        \end{align*}
                        so that $\beta\circ\alpha$ is a group homomorphism.
                  \item \textbf{Show that }
                        $(\beta\circ\alpha)(rm_1) = r[(\beta\circ\alpha)(m_1)]$
                        for all $r \in R$. Let $r \in R$. We have
                        \begin{align*}
                           (\beta\circ\alpha)(rm_1) &= \beta(\alpha(rm_1)) \\
                              &= \beta(r\alpha(m_1))
                              &[\alpha \text{ is an }R
                                \text{-module homomorphism}] \\
                              &= r\beta(\alpha(m_1))
                              &[\beta \text{ is an }R
                                \text{-module homomorphism}] \\
                              &= r[(\beta\circ\alpha)(m_1)].
                        \end{align*}
               \end{itemize}
               Conclude that $\beta\circ\alpha$ is an $R$-module isomorphism.
               Thus $(M, T) \in \mathcal{R}$, so that $\mathcal{R}$ is
               transitive.
      \end{itemize}
      The above shows us that $\mathcal{R}$ is an equivalence relation on
      $\mathscr{X}$. \qed

   \item[7.]   Prove that if $\phi : M \rightarrow N$ is an $R$-module
               homomorphism then
               $$\text{ker}(\phi) = \{m \in M : \phi(m) = 0\}$$
               is a submodule of $M$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $\phi : M \rightarrow N$ is an $R$-module
      homomorphism. Since $\phi$ is, in particular, a group homomorphism, it
      follows by Proposition 3.1 (4) (DF) that ker($\phi$) is a subgroup of $M$.
      So to show that ker($\phi$) is a submodule of $M$, it suffices to show
      ker($\phi$) is closed under scalar multiplication by $R$. So let $x \in R$
      and $a \in \text{ker}(\phi)$. Since $a$ is in the kernel of $\phi$, it
      follows that $\phi(a) = 0$. Since $\phi$ is an $R$-module homomorphism, we
      have that $\phi(xa) = x\phi(a) = x \cdot 0 = 0$, so that
      $xa \in \text{ker}(\phi)$, so that ker($\phi$) is an $R$-submodule of $M$.
