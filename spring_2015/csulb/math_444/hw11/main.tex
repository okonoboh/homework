%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item Consider the veracity or falsehood of each of the following statements.
         For bonus, argue for those that you believe are true while providing a
         counterexample for those that you believe are false.

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item $\Z(\sqrt{2})$ is a UFD.
            \item If $\alpha : R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then it is
                  one-to-one if the only $r \in R$ satisfying $\alpha(r) = 0$
                  is $r = 0$.
            \item Every integral domain is a field.
            \item If every element of a ring is an idempotent, then the ring is
                  commutative.
            \item The group of units of $\mathcal{M}_2(\Z_3)$ has 56 elements.
         \end{enumerate}
         
      \textbf{Solution.}

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
         \item a
      \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item Let
         $A = \left(\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
            $a$ & $b$ \\
            $2b$ & $a$
         \end{tabular}\right)$ be an element of $\Z(\sqrt{2})$. Suppose that
         $\det A$ is even. Show there is an element of $\Z(\sqrt{2})$ whose
         determinant is $\frac{1}{2}\det A$. \textbf{Hint.} Find an element of
         determinant 2 and show that you can divide $A$ by it.
         
      \textbf{Solution.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item \textbf{On Factoring.}

         \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
            \item Give all irreducible cubics over $\Z_2$.
            \item Factor $p(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ completely
                  in $\Z_2[x]$.
            \item How many monic quadratics are there in $\Z_3[x]$?
            \item Find all irreducible monic quadratics over $\Z_3$.
            \item Factor $q(x) = x^6 + x^3 - x^2 - x$ completely in $\Z_3[x]$.
            \item Consider the mod function from $\Z$ to $\Z_3$, and its natural
                  extension to a homomorphism from $\Z[x]$ to $\Z_3[x]$ that
                  mods out the coefficients, for example $5x$ goes to $2x$. Find
                  the image under this homomorphism of the polynomial
                  $$h(x) = x^6 + 9x^5 + 21x^4 + 37x^3 + 53x^2 + 29x + 15.$$
            \item Do the same as in \circled{6} except now one mods out 2.
            \item Use parts \circled{2} and \circled{5} to discuss the possible
                  factorization of $h(x)$. For example, does it have any integer
                  roots? Or is it irreducible etc. Discuss as much as you can.
         \end{enumerate}

            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^5 - 1$ in $\Q[x]$.
            \item Find real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that
                  $$(x^2+ax+1)(x^2+bx+1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1.$$
            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^5 - 1$ in $\R[x]$.
            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^5 - 1$ in $\C[x]$.
            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^5 - 1$ in $\Z_{11}[x]$.
            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^5 - 1$ in $\Z_{31}[x]$.
            \item Find the complete factorization of $x^{10} - 1$ in $\Q[x]$.
         \end{enumerate}
         
      \textbf{Solution.}
