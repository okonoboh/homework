   \item[4.01] Prove that if $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ then $f$ is bounded at
               $x_0$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $f : A \rightarrow \R$ is continuous at
      $x_0$. To show that $f$ is bounded at $x_0$, it suffices to show that
      $f$ is bounded on $N_{\delta}(x_0) \cap A$ for some $\delta > 0$. Since
      $f$ is continuous at $x_0$, it follows by definition that there exists
      $\delta_1 > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < 1$ whenever
      $|x - x_0| < \delta_1$. Using the triangle inequality we have that
      $$||f(x)| - |f(x_0)|| < |f(x) - f(x_0)| < 1,$$
      so that $|f(x)| - |f(x_0)| < 1$, if $|x - x_0| < \delta_1$. Thus
      $|f(x)| < 1 + |f(x_0)|$, if $|x - x_0| < \delta_1$. We have thus shown
      that $f$ is bounded on $N_{\delta_1}(x_0)$ by $1 + |f(x_0)|$, so that
      $f$ is bounded at $x_0$. \qed

               \end{enumerate}
               
      \textbf{Solution.}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Since
               $$3 = \lim_{x\rightarrow 0^-} f(x) \neq
                     \lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+} f(x) = 1
                 \text{ and }
                 27 = \lim_{x\rightarrow 3^-} f(x) \neq
                      \lim_{x\rightarrow 3^+} f(x) = 0$$
               it follows that $f$ has jump discontinuities at 0 and 3. The
               function $f$ has a discontinuity of the second kind at $x = 4$
               because $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4^-} f(x) = -\infty$; observe that
               $f$ is right-continuous at every point except for 0; also, $f$ is
               left-continuous at every point except for 3 and 4.
         \item Let $z$ be an integer. Then it follows that
               $f(z) = z + \gi{-z} = z + (-z) = 0$, and that
               $\lim_{x\rightarrow z^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\rightarrow z^+} x +
               \lim_{x\rightarrow z^+} \gi{-x} = z + (-z-1) = -1$.
