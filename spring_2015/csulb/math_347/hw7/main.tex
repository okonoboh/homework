%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.14%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.14] Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is self-adjoint, $\lambda \in \F$,
               and $\epsilon > 0$. Prove that if there exists $v \in V$ such
               that $||v|| = 1$ and
               $$||Tv - \lambda v|| < \epsilon,$$
               then $T$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda'$ such that
               $|\lambda - \lambda'| < \epsilon$.
               
      \textbf{Proof.} By the Spectral Theorem, there exists an orthornormal
      basis $(e_1, \ldots, e_n)$ of $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$ with
      corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$. Given $v \in V$,
      with $||v|| = 1$, we thus have $v = a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n$ for some
      unique scalars. Since $||v|| = 1$, it follows that at least one of the
      $a_i$s is nonzero. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         ||Tv - \lambda v||^2 &=  ||T(a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n)-a_1\lambda e_1 - \cdots -
                                    a_n\lambda e_n||^2 \\
            &= ||a_1\lambda_1e_1 + \cdots + a_n\lambda_ne_n-a_1\lambda e_1 - \cdots -
                 a_n\lambda e_n||^2 \\
            &= ||a_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda)e_1 + \cdots + a_n(\lambda_n - \lambda)e_n||^2 \\
            &= |a_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda)|^2 + \cdots + |a_n(\lambda_n - \lambda)|^2 \\
            &= |a_1|^2|\lambda_1 - \lambda|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2|\lambda_n - \lambda)|^2 \\
            &= |a_1|^2|\lambda - \lambda_1|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2|\lambda - \lambda_n|^2.
      \end{align*}
      
      Suppose to the contrary that $|\lambda - \lambda_i| \ge \epsilon$ for all
      $i = 1 \ldots n$. Then we must have that
      \begin{align*}
         ||Tv - \lambda v||^2 &= |a_1|^2|\lambda - \lambda_1|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2|\lambda - \lambda_n|^2 \\
        & \ge |a_1|^2\epsilon^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2\epsilon^2 \\
        &= (|a_1|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2)\epsilon^2 \\
        &= ||v||\epsilon^2 = \epsilon^2,
      \end{align*}
      so that $||Tv - \lambda v|| \ge \epsilon$, a contradiction. Thus, at least
      one of the eigenvalues of $T$, say $\lambda_j$, must be such that
      $|\lambda - \lambda_j| < \epsilon$. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.16%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.16] Give an example of an operator $T$ on an inner product space such
               that $T$ has an invariant subspace whose orthogonal complement is
               not invariant under $T$.

      \textbf{Answer.} Consider $T \in \mathcal{L}(F^3)$, where
      $T((a, b, c)) = (b, c, 0)$. Let $$U = \{(x, y, 0) : x, y \in \F\}.$$ Clearly
      $U$ is a subspace of $V$ and it is also invariant under $T$. Now we have
      $U^{\perp} = \{(0, 0, z) : z \in \F\}$. But $U^{\perp}$ is not invariant under
      $T$ since $(0, 0, 10) \in U^{\perp}$ but $T((0, 0, 10) = (0, 10, 0) \notin U^{\perp}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.17] Prove that the sum of any two positive operators on $V$ is
               positive.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $S$ and $T$ are positive operators on $V$.
      Since $S$ and $T$ are both self-adjoint, it follows immediately that
      $S + T$ is self-adjoint because
      $$(S+T)^* = S^*+T^* = S + T.$$
      Now let $v \in V$. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         \cyc{(S+T)v,v} &= \cyc{Sv + Tv, v} \\
            &= \cyc{Sv, v} + \cyc{Tv, v} \\
            &\ge 0, &[\text{Since } Sv \ge 0, Tv \ge 0]
      \end{align*}
      so that $S + T$ is a positive operator. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.19%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.19] Suppose that $T$ is a positive operator on $V$. Prove that $T$ is
               invertible if and only if
               $$\cyc{Tv, v} > 0$$
               for every $v \in V\;\backslash\;\{0\}$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose first that $T$ is invertible. Then it follows that
      $T$ is injective, so that $\text{null }T = \{0\}$. Let $v \in V$. Now 
      suppose that $\cyc{Tv, v} = 0$. By the Spectral Theorem, there exists an 
      orthonormal basis $(e_1, \ldots, e_n)$  of $V$ consisting of eigenvectors
      of $T$. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ denote the corresponding real
      ($T$ is self-adjoint) and nonnegative (Theorem 7.27 (b)) eigenvalues. 
      Since the eigenvectors are independent, they must be nonzero. Thus
      $e_i \notin \text{null }T$, so that $0 \neq T(e_i) = \lambda_ie_i$. That
      is, all the eigenvalues are positive. Now we have
      $v = a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n$, so that
      \begin{align*}
         0 &= \cyc{Tv, v} \\
           &= \cyc{T(a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n), a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n} \\
           &= \cyc{T(a_1e_1) + \cdots + T(a_ne_n), a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n} \\
           &= \cyc{a_1\lambda_1e_1 + \cdots + a_n\lambda_ne_n,
                   a_1e_1 + \cdots + a_ne_n} \\
           &= a_1\overline{a_1}\lambda_1\cyc{e_1, e_1} + \cdots +
              a_n\overline{a_n}\lambda_n\cyc{e_n, e_n} \\
           &= |a_1|^2\lambda_1 + \cdots + |a_n|^2\lambda_n.
      \end{align*}

      Since the eigenvalues are all positive, it must be the case
      $a_1 = \cdots = a_n = 0$, so that $v = 0$. So it follows that if $v \in V$
      is nonzero, we must have that $\cyc{Tv, v} > 0$. \\

      Conversely suppose that $\cyc{Tv, v} > 0$ for all nonzero $v \in V$. Let
      $x \in \text{null }T$. Then it follows that $x$ is not nonzero because
      $$0 = \cyc{0, x} = \cyc{Tx, x}.$$
      Thus $x = 0$; that is $\text{null }T = \{0\}$. Thus $T$ is injective
      (and surjective) and thus invertible. \qed      
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.22%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.22] Prove that if $S \in \mathcal{L}(\R^3)$ is an isometry, then
               there exists a nonzero vector $x \in \R^3$ such that $S^2x = x$.

      \textbf{Proof.} Assume that $S \in \mathcal{L}(\R^3)$ is an isometry.
      Since dim $\R^3$ is odd, it follows by Theorem 7.38 that $S$ has an
      eigenvalue of 1 or $-1$. Suppose first that $S$ has an eigenvalue of 1.
      Then there exists a nonzero vector $x$ such that $Sx = x$. Thus we have
      that
      $$S^2x = S(Sx) = Sx = x.$$
      Now suppose that $S$ has an eigenvalue of $-1$. Then there exists a
      nonzero vector $c$ such that $Sc = -c$. Let $y = -c$. Then we have that
      $$S^2y = S(Sy) = S(S(-c)) = S(-S(c)) = S(c) = -c = y,$$
      as desired. \qed
