%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.14%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.14] Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is self-adjoint, $\lambda \in \F$,
               and $\epsilon > 0$. Prove that if there exists $v \in V$ such
               that $||v|| = 1$ and
               $$||Tv - \lambda v|| < \epsilon,$$
               then $T$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda'$ such that
               $|\lambda - \lambda'| < \epsilon$.
               
      \textbf{Proof.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.16%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.16] Give an example of an operator $T$ on an inner product space such
               that $T$ has an invariant subspace whose orthogonal complement is
               not invariant under $T$.

      \textbf{Answer.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.17] Prove that the sum of any two positive operators on $V$ is
               positive.

      \textbf{Proof.} Suppose that $S$ and $T$ are positive operators on $V$.
      Since $S$ and $T$ are both self-adjoint, it follows immediately that
      $S + T$ is self-adjoint because
      $$(S+T)^* = S^*+T^* = S + T.$$
      Now let $v \in V$. Thus
      \begin{align*}
         \cyc{(S+T)v,v} &= \cyc{Sv + Tv, v} \\
            &= \cyc{Sv, v} + \cyc{Tv, v} \\
            &\ge 0, &[\text{Since } Sv \ge 0, Tv \ge 0]
      \end{align*}
      so that $S + T$ is a positive operator. \qed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.19%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.19] Suppose that $T$ is a positive operator on $V$. Prove that $T$ is
               invertible if and only if
               $$\cyc{Tv, v} > 0$$
               for every $v \in V\;\backslash\;\{0\}$.

      \textbf{Proof.}
      
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob7.22%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[7.22] Prove that if $S \in \mathcal{L}(\R^3)$ is an isometry, then
               there exists a nonzero vector $x \in \R^3$ such that $S^2x = x$.

      \textbf{Proof.}
