%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob6.6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.6]  Prove that if $V$ is a real inner-product space, then
               $$\cyc{u, v} = \frac{||u + v||^2 - ||u - v||^2}{4}$$
               for all $u. v \in V$.

      \textbf{Proof.} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob6.10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.10] On $\mathcal{P}_2(\R)$, consider the inner product given by
               $$\cyc{p, q} = \int_0^1p(x)q(x) dx.$$

               Apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure to the basis $(1, x, x^2)$ to
               produce an orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{P}_2(\R)$.

      \textbf{Solution.} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob6.13%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.13] Suppose $(e_1, \ldots, e_m)$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in
               $V$. Let $v \in V$. Prove that
               $$||v||^2 = |\cyc{v, e_1}|^2 + \cdots + |\cyc{v, e_m}|^2$$
               if and only if $v \in \text{span}(e_1, \ldots, e_m)$.
               
      \textbf{Proof.} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob6.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.17] Prove that if $P \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is such that $P^2 = P$ and
               every vector in null $P$ is orthogonal to every vector in range
               $P$, then $P$ is an orthogonal projection.
               
      \textbf{Proof.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Prob6.29%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \item[6.29] Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L(V)}$ and $U$ is a subspace of $V$.
               Prove that $U$ is invariant under $T$ if and only if $U^\perp$
               is invariant under $T*$.
               
      \textbf{Proof.}
